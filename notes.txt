1. Changed body margin to 0 to remove outer whitespace
2. Added "float: left" to .product
3. Added "margin: 10px" to .product
4. Added "color: red" to a:hover
   Changed href links to products to be different 
5. Added "margin-top: 0" to h2
6. This CSS clears the "float: left" property that we added to .product.
   This is to prevent the footer from floating to the left of the final product.
